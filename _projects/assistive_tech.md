## Overview

Through ASME and the Illinois Assistive Technology Program (IATP), I designed and prototyped devices intended for people with limited use of one hand. Each device had to be operable with a single hand, safe for daily use, lightweight, and manufacturable as a single 3D print with minimal assembly.

## Devices

**Vegetable slicer** — A one-handed cutting aid that secures produce while the user slices. The design constrains the vegetable position so the user doesn't need a second hand to stabilize it.

**Ziplock bag closer** — Lets a user open and seal ziplock bags without needing to pinch the seal with two hands. The mechanism guides the bag through a closing channel.

**iPad holder** — A stand that holds an iPad at a comfortable viewing angle with a single-hand insertion and release mechanism.

## Design Constraints

The real challenge in this project wasn't making something that works — it was making something that works _within tight constraints_:

- **Single-hand operation** — every interaction must be completable with one hand
- **Single-print fabrication** — no multi-part assemblies or fasteners
- **Short print time** — practical for production
- **Lightweight** — users may have limited grip strength
- **Safety** — no pinch points, sharp edges, or unstable positions

These constraints forced careful thought about geometry, tolerances, and how a user would actually interact with the device. You have to think about the worst-case grip angle, the weakest plausible force, and what happens when someone uses it differently than you intended.

## What I Learned

I collaborated with the ASME team and the IATP project manager to meet functional and safety requirements. Designing for accessibility taught me to take user constraints as seriously as structural or manufacturing constraints — the requirements come from real people with real limitations, not a spec sheet.
