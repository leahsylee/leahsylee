## Overview

Through ASME and the Illinois Assistive Technology Program, I designed and fabricated devices intended for people with limited use of one hand. Each device had to be operable with a single hand, safe for daily use, lightweight, and manufacturable as a single 3D print with minimal assembly.

## Devices

**Vegetable slicer** — A one-handed cutting aid that secures produce while the user slices. The design constrains the vegetable position so the user doesn't need a second hand to stabilize it.

**Zip-lock bag closer** — Lets a user open and seal zip-lock bags without needing to pinch the seal with two hands. The mechanism guides the bag through a closing channel.

**Tablet holder** — A stand that holds a tablet at a comfortable viewing angle with a single-hand insertion and release mechanism.

## Design Constraints

The real challenge in this project wasn't making something that works — it was making something that works *within tight constraints*:

- **Single-hand operation** — every interaction must be completable with one hand
- **Single-print fabrication** — no multi-part assemblies or fasteners
- **Lightweight** — users may have limited grip strength
- **Safety** — no pinch points, sharp edges, or unstable positions

These constraints forced careful thought about geometry, tolerances, and how a user would actually interact with the device. It's different from designing for an ideal user — you have to think about the worst-case grip angle, the weakest plausible force, and what happens when someone uses it differently than you intended.

## What I Learned

Designing for accessibility taught me to take user constraints as seriously as structural or manufacturing constraints. The engineering process is the same — define requirements, prototype, test, iterate — but the requirements come from real people with real limitations, not a spec sheet.
