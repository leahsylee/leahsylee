## Overview

Illini Solar Car builds a formula-style solar-powered race vehicle that competes in national events. I work on the Mechanical/Structures subteam, focused on composite manufacturing and vehicle integration.

My responsibilities span the full manufacturing process for the car's fairing (body panels): designing molds, performing composite layups, and finishing surfaces to meet aerodynamic and structural requirements. The work is hands-on and deadline-driven — competition schedules don't move.

## What I Work On

**Mold design and fabrication** for the fairing door. This involves defining the mold geometry to match the aerodynamic surface, selecting materials, and building the mold to hold up through multiple layup cycles.

**Composite layups** using carbon fiber and fiberglass. Each layup follows a specific ply schedule and orientation to meet structural targets while keeping weight down. After layup, I run vacuum bagging to consolidate the laminate and remove excess resin.

**Post-processing** — trimming, sanding, and surface finishing to bring parts to final dimensions and surface quality. Small deviations in the fairing surface affect aerodynamic performance, so the tolerances matter.

**Integration and assembly.** Getting composite panels to mount correctly onto the vehicle chassis is where most of the real problem-solving happens. I've resolved alignment issues where panel geometry didn't match the frame as expected, requiring iterative adjustment of mounting hardware and panel trim lines.

## Cross-Team Coordination

Solar car development requires constant coordination between subsystems. Panel geometry is driven by aerodynamics, structural loads are defined by the structures team, and mounting locations depend on electrical component placement. Changes in one area cascade into others, so communication across teams is a regular part of the work.

## Why This Matters

This is hands-on vehicle build experience at a level that most students don't get in a classroom. I've learned how to make manufacturing decisions under real constraints — weight budgets, schedule pressure, material availability, and the gap between a CAD model and a physical part that needs to actually fit on the car.
