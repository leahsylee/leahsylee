## Overview

Illini Solar Car builds a formula-style solar-powered race vehicle that competes in national events. I work on the Mechanical/Structures subteam, focused on composite manufacturing and vehicle integration.

I lead the design and fabrication of fairing door molds using 3D-printed tooling and carbon fiber/fiberglass composite layup. The work spans the full manufacturing process for the car's fairing (body panels): designing molds, performing composite layups, and finishing surfaces to meet aerodynamic and structural requirements. Competition schedules don't move, so the work is deadline-driven.

## What I Work On

**Mold design with 3D-printed tooling.** I design the mold geometry to match the aerodynamic surface, using 3D-printed tooling to create accurate and repeatable mold forms. This approach lets us iterate on mold designs faster than traditional machining while maintaining the surface accuracy needed for aerodynamic panels.

**Composite layup and vacuum bagging.** Carbon fiber and fiberglass layups follow specific ply schedules and orientations to meet structural targets while keeping weight down. After layup, I run vacuum bagging to consolidate the laminate and remove excess resin.

**Post-processing.** Sanding, trimming, and surface finishing bring parts to final dimensions and surface quality. Small deviations in the fairing surface affect aerodynamic performance, so the tolerances matter.

**Integration and assembly.** Getting composite panels to mount correctly onto the vehicle chassis is where most of the real problem-solving happens. I coordinate with aero, structures, and melec (mechanical-electrical) teams to ensure proper fit and integration of structural components.

## Why This Matters

This is hands-on vehicle build experience at a level that most students don't get in a classroom. I've learned how to make manufacturing decisions under real constraints — weight budgets, schedule pressure, material availability, and the gap between a CAD model and a physical part that needs to actually fit on the car.
