  abstract      = {We present a spherical tactile sensor based on the GelSight principle, enabling omnidirectional contact geometry reconstruction. The sensor uses a novel spherical elastomer design with integrated illumination and a calibrated photometric stereo pipeline for surface normal estimation. We describe the fabrication process, calibration procedure, and image reconstruction pipeline, and demonstrate repeatable tactile sensing across varied contact geometries.},
