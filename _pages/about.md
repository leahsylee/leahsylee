I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, expecting to graduate in December 2027.

I work on physical systems such as composite vehicle structures, robotic mechanisms, and tactile sensors — with an emphasis on testing and iteration. Much of my time is spent debugging real hardware: misalignment during assembly, unstable contact between mechanisms and surfaces, or inconsistent sensor measurements, and then modifying the design or setup until the behavior is repeatable.

On [Illini Solar Car](projects/), I design and manufacture composite fairing door molds using 3D-printed tooling and carbon fiber/fiberglass layup, and work with other subteams during vehicle assembly and integration. I also work on two research projects. At the [Novel Mobile Robots Lab](research/), I develop a self-actuated climbing inspection robot, focusing on mechanism design, system integration, and testing. At the [RoboTouch Lab](research/), I fabricate and calibrate a spherical tactile sensor and build the image reconstruction pipeline. For this project, a conference paper is being prepared for submission to IROS.
