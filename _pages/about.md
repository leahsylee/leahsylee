I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, expected to graduate in May 2028.

My work focuses on building, testing, and integrating physical systems — from composite vehicle structures to robotic mechanisms and tactile sensors. I'm most drawn to the problems that come after a design looks good on paper: getting parts to fit, making systems behave consistently, and figuring out why something works in one test but not the next.

At [Illini Solar Car](/projects/), I design and fabricate composite body panels for a formula-style solar race vehicle, working through the full process from mold design to final surface finishing. In the [RoboTouch Lab](/research/) at UIUC, I work on two separate research projects — a self-actuated climbing robot where I focus on closed-loop contact control, and a spherical tactile sensor involving fabrication, calibration, and image reconstruction. A patent has been filed for the sensor design, and a conference paper is being prepared for IROS.

I'm interested in vehicle systems engineering, mechanical design, and testing — roles where understanding how real hardware behaves matters as much as the design itself.
