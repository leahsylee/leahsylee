I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, expecting to graduate in December 2027.

My work focuses on building, testing, and integrating physical systems — from composite vehicle structures to robotic mechanisms and tactile sensors. I'm most drawn to the problems that come after a design looks good on paper: getting parts to fit, making systems behave consistently, and figuring out why something works in one test but not the next.

At [Illini Solar Car](/projects/), I lead the design and fabrication of composite fairing door molds using 3D-printed tooling and carbon fiber/fiberglass layup. In two separate research labs, I work on a self-actuated climbing robot at the [Novel Mobile Robots Lab](/research/) (contact mechanism design and closed-loop control) and a spherical tactile sensor at the [RoboTouch Lab](/research/) (hardware fabrication, calibration, and image reconstruction). A conference paper on the sensor has been submitted to IROS.

I'm interested in vehicle systems engineering, mechanical design, and testing — roles where understanding how real hardware behaves matters as much as the design itself.
