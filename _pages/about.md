I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, expecting to graduate in December 2027.

I build and test 
cal systems such as composite vehicle structures, robotic mechanisms, and tactile sensors. Most of my work starts after a design looks correct on paper: getting parts to fit, making systems behave consistently, and figuring out why something works in one test but not the next.

On [Illini Solar Car](projects/), I design and manufacture composite fairing door molds using 3D-printed tooling and carbon fiber/fiberglass layup. I also work on two separate research projects. At the [Novel Mobile Robots Lab](research/), I develop a self-actuated climbing robot, focusing on mechanism design and closed-loop contact control. At the [RoboTouch Lab](research/), I fabricate and calibrate a spherical tactile sensor and built the image reconstruction pipeline; a conference paper is being prepared for submission to IROS.

I am interested in vehicle systems engineering, mechanical design, and testing — especially roles where diagnosing real hardware behavior is as important as designing it.
