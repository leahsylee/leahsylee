        summary: Working on two separate projects — a self-actuated climbing robot (system integration and controls) and a spherical GelSight tactile sensor (instrumentation and fabrication). Diagnosed inconsistent climbing behavior through root cause analysis, and developed repeatable fabrication and calibration processes for the tactile sensor.
        highlights:
          - "Climbing robot: closed-loop contact control, force/pressure feedback, testing rig design"
          - "Tactile sensor: mold design, silicone casting, PCB integration, photometric stereo reconstruction"
          - "Patent filed for spherical sensor design; IROS conference paper in preparation"

        summary: Design and fabricate composite fairing components for a formula-style solar race vehicle. Work spans the full manufacturing process from mold design through final surface finishing, coordinating across aerodynamics, structures, and electrical teams.
        highlights:
          - Carbon fiber and fiberglass composite layups, vacuum bagging, trimming, sanding
          - Solved alignment and mounting issues during vehicle assembly
          - Worked under strict competition deadlines with cross-functional teams

        summary: Built an internal research tool for Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Developed a RAG system, evaluated LLMs and embedding models, and created automated pipelines to crawl and structure technical documentation for model training.
        highlights:
          - Built dataset preparation pipeline (PDF/HTML to structured training data)
          - Evaluated multiple LLMs and embedding models with structured test results
          - Presented findings to company leadership including CEO
